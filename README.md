# <Your-Project-Title>

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- To enter a field with more job opportunities and also provides a way to focus on skills that I enjoy and find interesting to work on and for. 
- The reason this was built was to provide me with a hands-on introduction to GIT, Github, VScode, Chrome Developer, HTML, CSS, and JavaSript.
- This website provides a platform for me to build on knowledge acquired throughout the course all in one convenient place that's easily accessible.
- Through building this website I have learned key introductory coding skills to get me a basis for this boot camp course.


## Installation

The first step we needed to have is just to have a fundamental folder established to build on all the branches of the topics we learned to create the site. We first did this by downloading a basic file provided by the boot camp. From here we were able to build on what we learned by adding notes by creating a new branch. To do this we would need to open GIT to enter the correct file. On the command line add cd and the computer file location for your prework-study-guide we download. [EX: cd /c/users/stefano/desktop/developer/projects/prework-study-guide]. From there we need the next following commands -->  git checkout -b feature/add-<"The file you are adding name"> --> code . . After you have followed these commands VScode will open up and allow you to add code to these new branches. Using the website with directions on how to build our code on each specific branch we went over the concept of how the codes we were adding functioned as well as how to debug. Once we have added all the coding we needed for each of the branches, we needed to connect our VSCode to our Git and our Github with the new additions. To do this we went back to GIT and used the following commands in order --> git add -A --> git commit -m<"Notes of what you have added/created"> --> git pull origin main. From there  Github link will be created in the notes from Git. Open the link and from there you are going to pull requests, merge, and commit the project by clicking on those buttons. You can make sure the changes are there by looking at the code now in your Github account --> Main --> and the branch you were working on. To do this also you can go back to Git and on the command line enter git status. We do this to every branch we need to add for our website built of the different topics. While we are making these changes we are also using on VScode a command at the bottom left corner which states "Go Live". It will open up an HTML and you can see all the changes we are making appear in real-time. From here we also use Chrome Developer to better understand the code as well. To enter Chrome Developer go first to settings on the top right of the page --> more --> and then Developer Tools which opens the console line for our website.
