# <Your-Project-Title>

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- To enter a field with more job opportunities and also provides a way to focusing on skills that I enjoy and find interesting to work on and for. 
- The reason this was built was to provide me with a hands on introduction to GIT, Github, VScode, Chrome Developer, HTML, CSS, and Java.
- This website provides a platform for me to build on knowlegde acquired throughout the course all in one convenient place that's easily accessible.
- Through building this website I have learned key introductionary coding skills to get me a basis for this bootcamp course.


## Installation

The first step we needed to have is just have a fundamental folder establish to build on all the branches of the topics we learned to create the site. We first did this by downloading a basic file provided by the bootcamp. From here we were able to build on what we learned by adding notes by creating a new branch. To do this we would need to open GIT to enter the correct file. On the command line add cd and the computer file location for your prework-study-guide we downloand. [EX: cd /c/users/stefano/desktop/developer/projects/prework-study-guide]. From there we need the next following commands -->  git checkout -b feature/add-<"The file you are adding name"> --> code . . After you have followed these commands VScode will open up and allow you to add code to these new branches. Using the website with directions on how to build our code on each specific branch we went over the concept of how thee codes we were adding functioned as well as how to debugging. Once we have added all the coding we needed for each of the branches, we needed to connect our VSCode to our Git and our Github with the new additons. To do this we went back to GIT and used the following commands in order --> git add -A --> git commit -m<"Notes of what you have added/created"> --> git pull origin main. From there  Github link will be created in the notes from Git. Open the link and from there you are going to pull request, merge and commit the project by clicking on a those buttons. You can make sure the changes are there by looking at the code now in your Github account --> Main --> and the branch you were working on. To do this also you can go back on Git and on the command line enter git status. We do this to every branch we need to add for our website built of the different topics. While we are making on these changes we are also using on VScode a command at the bottom left corner which states "Go Live". It will open up a HTML and you can see all the changes we are making appear in real time. From here we also use Chrome Developer to better understand the code as well. To enter Chrome Developer go first to settings on the top right of the page --> more --> and then Developer Tools which opens the console line for our website. 




  


## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative file path, add it to your README using the following syntax:

![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)

## Credits

List your collaborators, if any, with links to their GitHub profiles.

If you used any third-party assets that require attribution, list the creators with links to their primary web presence in this section.

If you followed tutorials, include links to those here as well.

## License

The last section of a high-quality README file is the license. This lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project. If you need help choosing a license, refer to [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/).

üèÜ The previous sections are the bare minimum, and your project will ultimately determine the content of this document. You might also want to consider adding the following sections.

## Badges

![badmath](https://img.shields.io/github/languages/top/nielsenjared/badmath)

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
